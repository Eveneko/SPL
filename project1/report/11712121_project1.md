## AST Node

```c
typedef struct astNode{
    char *astNodeName;
    tokenType astNodeType;
    char *astNodeValue;
    int lineno;
    int childNum; 
    struct astNode **childNodes;
}astNode;
```

## Function

- Pass all the test cases from teacher and SA.
- Pass all the test cases from me.
- Basic
    - print out syntax tree
    - Lexical error (error type A)
    - Syntax error (error type B)
    - Supporting hexadecimal representation of integers (0x12)
    - Supporting hex-form characters, such (\x90)

## Steps

1. write `ast.h` and `ast.c` to implement the syntax tree.
2. write `lex.l` to generate the regular expression by tokens.
3. write `syntax.y` by the rule we got already.
4. write `Makefile` and know which test case we can not pass.
5. fix them case by case and test again until all the test cases are passed.

## Studying Gains

- `va_start` initializes an object of this type in such a way that subsequent calls to va_arg sequentially retrieve the additional arguments passed to the function.
- `typdef`
    ```
    struct tag_name {
        type member1;
        type member2;
    };

    typedef struct tag_name {
        type member1;
        type member2;
    } struct_alias;
    ```
- `%option yylineno` Flex has already provided built-in mechanism for this, by a global variable yylineno which will automatically increase by 1 after scanning each line.
- `%pure-parser` A reentrant program is one which does not alter in the course of execution; in other words, it consists entirely of pure (read-only) code. Reentrancy is important whenever asynchronous execution is possible;
- `%locations` get more accurate syntax error messages
- `%start` where to start the parser
